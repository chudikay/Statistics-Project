Goal of Analysis

Previous analysis has shown that the population mean of the cholesterol level is 5.95 and the standard deviation is 0.897. The research team is trying to determine whether an individual’s cholesterol level has changed or not after applying a certain diet program properly for the past 6 months.

We start by stating the Hypothesis Statement (by using an ‘if’ statement) as this helps solve the research question.

Next, we assess the normality of the dataset by QQ plot or a histogram. 

Then, a step-by-step analysis on R to prove (or dis-prove) our hypothesis statements developed above.
